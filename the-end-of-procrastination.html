	<h2 class="title"> What is The End of Procrastination About? </h2>

	<p>Information in The End of Procrastination can be divided into two parts: understanding why we procrastinate and implementing the necessary tools to stop us from doing so. One of the causes of why we don’t do what we tell ourselves to do is because our “emotional” brain becomes scared of trying out things too far outside our comfort zone. The Habit List, a concept introduced in this read, is a tool that will help you overcome your emotional brain and experience magical results. </p>

	<p>Both of these tools will be elaborated further later in the review!</p>

<h2 class="title"> Design </h2>

	<div class="design">
		<p>The design in The End of Procrastination is arguably one of the most modern and intuitive ones I’ve seen. Taking the book out of the shelf, we are greeted by a red, white, and black cover. This theme continues throughout the information and paragraphs.  </p>

		<p>In this read, Ludwig and Schicker show us that procrastination can be dealt with by tackling four areas of personal development: motivation, discipline, outcomes, and objectivity. My favorite design features in The End of Procrastination include the small summaries at the end of each development area and drawings every 3 pages that summarize what was recently discussed. This allows readers to easily skim through the book if they need a refresher on any of the key concepts and information. </p>

<h2 class="title"> Quality of Content </h2>

	<h3 class="sub-title">Quality of Information </h3>

		<p>As mentioned previously, The End of Procrastination primarily discusses why we procrastinate and how we can stop ourselves from doing so by building motivation and discipline. Both authors overdelivered by giving suggestions on what to do if building new habits didn’t work out as intended (for example if you suddenly became sick and wasn’t use the tools). This was something I especially appreciated. I have read about different perspectives on building a habit but definitely not a Plan B!</p>

		<p>With information overload in today’s society, it’s difficult to tell whether information is true or made up. Fortunately, both authors knew this and supported 90% of all information and tools in The End of Procrastination with real world research (such as Seligman’s rodent research and the Stanford Prison Experiment). This was a revelation to me since I knew I could trust the facts and strategies in this book, even though they came from two authors who I’ve never heard about!</p>

	<h3 class="sub-title"> Elephants, Riders, and Emotional Aversion! </h3>

		<p>Why don’t we do things we tell ourselves to do? </p>

		<p>Two important parts of the brain dictate the actions we carry out: our “emotional” brain (which The End of Procrastination represents with an elephant) and the “rational” brain (represented by a rider). These two beings constantly clash with each other since the elephant wants to do comfortable, fun, and relaxing things while the rider knows what is necessary to do. We enter the state of flow is when the elephant and the rider agree to tackle the same activity; the elephant finds it interesting and enjoyable while the rider knows that the task will help its owner move towards his/her personal vision.</p>

		<p>Even with vast amounts of willpower, the rider loses his control on the elephant when they encounter emotional aversion. An example of this issue may involve completing a task that forces an individual to take a big step outside his/her comfort zone. Fortunately, a tool called the Habit List is the perfect solution to this problem and will be discussed in the Call to Action section! </p>

		<p> All in all, this simple but meaningful analogy of the elephant and the rider radically changed my view on why we procrastinate and how this problem can be dealt with!</p>

	<h3 class="sub-title">Language</h3>
	
		<p>As with most self-improvement books, The End of Procrastination has a casual but informative tone. There aren’t any words or phrases that have difficult wording or vocabulary, so foreign English speakers who have immersed themselves in the language should be fine. If a key concept or principle is difficult to understand, simply find the drawing that corresponds to the topic being discussed. Along with a visual description, most illustrations have a small caption that sums up an entire page into one sentence.  </p>




<h2 class="title"> Call to Action </h2>
<p>The 8 tools found in The End of Procrastination are definitely most unique since they were developed by the authors themselves. 7 of the methods discussed are ones I have not heard of, and 3 – 4 of the tools are used for getting back on the road of building habits and ending procrastination. All these tools are for you to implement immediately, which together creates the biggest call to action I have ever seen.</p>

<p class="caption"> The Habit List! </p>


	<h3 class="sub-title">Habit List</h3>
	<p>I promised that I will be doing a small explanation of this life-changing tool, so here it is!</p>

<p>In a nutshell, the Habit List is a method to visually see how you are doing in your journey of building life-changing habits. To implement, create a table and list all the habits you want to build in the first row. Both authors suggest writing down only 3 – 5 when you first begin this method. </p>

<p>In the next row, write down the minimum amount of times you want to see this action done. It is in this section where the Habit List is able to beat emotional aversion. Say you want to start running in the morning. Instead of going for 6 miles on the first day, begin from 1 mile and slowly add 1 -2 miles every two weeks. Doing so will not terrify your elephant, which is necessary if you want it to become comfortable with this new change and move on to the next level.  </p>

<p>Before you end the day, come back to the Habit List. For each habit, fill in a green circle if you were able to reach the minimum or a red circle if you didn’t. After this, give yourself a rating from 1 – 10 that sums up your productivity and self-regulation for the day. </p>

<p>Why does this method work? Well, our brain is shown to keep track of visual information (pictures, diagrams, color) much faster than words. The green and red dots immediately allow you to see what habits you are doing well and slacking off in, informing you on whether to maintain or change our actions. Personally, I feel that this visual feedback even encourages an motivates me to complete the daily minimum!</p>

<h2 class="title"> Conclusion: </h2>

<p>I picked up this book to deal with my problem of procrastination, and I have to say that it has went above and beyond in fulfilling its purpose. Real world research allowed me to understand why I didn’t follow through with what I told myself to do, and the 8 simple but comprehensive tips made up my toolkit of building long-lasting habits and entering the state of flow. The language of the book makes information simple and concise while drawings further my understanding of procrastination and habit building. </p>

<p>Due to all this, The End of Procrastination deserves a 10/10.  </p>
